# Patronizing language detection

This repository contains the codebase for our participation to SemEval-2022 Task4, subtask 1 - Patronizing and Condescending Language Detection. 

Submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Natural Language Processing course of Imperial College London, in March 2022.

Authors: Mathilde Outters, Elizabeth Bates, Venus Cheung



## Task
The overall goal of this project is to develop a binary classification model to predict whether a text contains patronising or condescending language.
More specifically, the coursework requires an implementation of a transformer-based model from Huggingface that outperforms the taskâ€™s RoBERTa-base baseline (provided by the organisers) in F1 score on the official dev dataset (0.48).
